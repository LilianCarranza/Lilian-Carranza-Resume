        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanish TeacherðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Having grown up in a Mexican household I was able to gain the skills of speaking two languages, being English and Spanish. At home I would practice my Spanish while outside of my house I would speak in English. In middle school I took a Spanish class, in order to practice Spanish more because I was not getting enough practice at home. Growing up I would always watch Spanish television with my mother to improve my understanding of the words being spoken and get used to different accents of Spanish that existed. Through this I gained a great understanding of the language. Because of this I was able to understand many words and help other family members, who did not understand English, with living in an English speaking country.<br><br>

        Being able to learn a language is hard work if not taught since a young age or while growing up. So because of this I took on a challenge to learn another language besides Spanish, which was Chinese. In high school I took three years of Chinese in order to experience what it is like for people who have no idea how to speak another language would feel. For me to acquire the different study and learning tactics of learning a new language I would have to take Chinese classes, which I had no background knowledge about. Through this I learned that everyone has their own study technique and everyone learns differently. There is no one way of studying or teaching a subject. Some learn through note taking, others through flash cards, and even just writing words over and over again. For the teacher, they had to adapt to everyone's different studying styles and work with their students in whatever way helped them best. While speaking with my classmates and helping each other study I learned that there are also students who have to work harder than others because it is just hard for some people to comprehend and remember material compared to others who just seem to have photographic memory. I learned that learning another language is a lot harder than I thought it would be, since I had never really experienced this before. It takes a lot of time and effort, just like everything else, to be able to master a new language.<br><br>

        While learning another language, that was not Spanish, I began to slowly lose the ability to speak Spanish. I still understood a lot, but then my grammar and vocabulary began to drop, making me unable to respond back and talk with other Spanish speakers. Languages take a lot of practice and in order to keep any ability you need to always be practicing that ability. So while my ability to speak Chinese increased, my ability to speak Spanish decreased. It was then time for me to brush up on my Spanish and in order to do that I started asking my family members to speak to me in Spanish. I learned that the best way to learn any language is just to dive right in and start speaking the language. Talking and interacting with others is the best and most efficient way. When you think about it, how did we learn our first language? Well that was through our parents speaking and interacting with us in whatever language or languages they wanted us to speak. We had no school to teach us, we simply just remembered and repeated what was spoken to us and eventually we could speak fluently.
